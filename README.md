# API using Stanford Core-NLP

Analyzing text data using Stanfordâ€™s CoreNLP makes text data analysis easy and efficient. With just a few lines of code, CoreNLP allows for the extraction of all kinds of text properties, such as named-entity recognition or part-of-speech tagging. CoreNLP is written in Java and requires Java to be installed on your device but offers programming interfaces for several popular programming languages, including Python.

Additionally, it supports four languages other than English: Arabic, Chinese, German, French, and Spanish.

Stanford CoreNLP provides a set of natural language analysis tools which can take raw English language text input and give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and word dependencies, and indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities. It provides the foundational building blocks for higher level text understanding applications.
